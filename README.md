# Hangar Base

The **Hangar Base** project is interactive display system inspired by mecha hangars, designed primarily for showcasing **Gunpla** (Gundam plastic models). It detects the presence of a Gunpla placed on the hangar and provides visual and/or audio feedback depending on the detection status. It combines basic sensor input with display output to create a dynamic user experience.

## ðŸš€ Project Description

This project is to simulate a hangar base using arduino components. The base will:

* **Display "Hangar Empty"** when no object (e.g., Gunpla) is detected.
* **Show basic stats or information** (like unit name, model type, serial number, etc.) when a Gunpla is detected on the base.
* **Play sound effects or background music**.
* **Read object-specific data** using RFID (in the future).

The system uses distance sensing to determine if an object is present, and can optionally identify specific models using RFID tags.

Notes: Originally, I attempt to use RFID (MFRC522) to identify specific Gunpla units and display unique stats. However, due to technical issuesâ€”despite correct wiring and working codeâ€”the RFID module failed to detect any tags. As a result, the project was refactored to rely entirely on a distance sensor (HC-SR04) for presence detection.

## ðŸ§© Required Components

| Component                            | Description                                            |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **OLED SSD1306 (128x64 Mono)**       | Displays visual information when Gunpla is present     |
| **LCD I2C 16x2**                     | Used for showing status text or static data            |
| **HC-SR04 Distance Sensor**          | Detects if something (Gunpla) is present in the hangar |
| **MFRC522 RFID Reader** *(Optional)* | Used to detect specific Gunpla via RFID tags           |
| **DFPlayer Mini**                    | Plays MP3 audio files such as startup sounds or themes |
| **Speaker**                          | Outputs audio from the DFPlayer Mini                   |
| **Hangar Base**                      | A physical diorama or platform for placing the Gunpla  |
| **Gunpla Model** *(or test object)*  | The model that activates the display and sound         |

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. The **HC-SR04** distance sensor monitors the presence of a model in the hangar.
2. When **no object is detected**, the system shows "Hangar Empty" on the displays.
3. When a **Gunpla is detected**, the system:

   * Displays predefined stats (e.g., unit name, serial code) on the **OLED or LCD**.
   * (Optionally) Identifies the specific model via **RFID** and shows unique stats.
   * (Optionally) Plays audio using **DFPlayer Mini** and a **Speaker**.
4. All feedback (visual/audio) is updated in real-time based on presence detection.
